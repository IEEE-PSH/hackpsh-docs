### Creating a Branch

Separate branches will be made to differentiate implementations for the application. New changes will **NOT** be made directly in the master branch.

1. Click on the current branch on the bottom-left labeled `master`.
2. Click on `Create a new branch`.
3. Name the branch with something descriptive (ex: `navbar-testing`).

You can switch branches by clicking on the branch name and clicking on the refresh symbol to sync with its changes. If your files do not sync properly, navigate to `View > Command Palette` or `Ctrl + Shift + P` and enter `Fetch`.

<br />

### Committing Changes

All changes in the current branch will be tracked, indicated by the Source Control tab located on the left. To commit changes:

1. Stage changes to prepare for commit.
2. Add a descriptive message to your commit (ex: `changed colors of navbar`).
3. Click `Commit` to commit locally or `Commit & Sync` to commit to GitHub.

You must commit changes to visit other branches.

### Submitting Pull Requests

Submit pull requests to potentially have your changes merge with the master branch.

1. Go to the specific branch on GitHub.
2. At the top, click on `Compare and pull request`.
3. Fill out the form with information about the request.
4. Wait for feedback or approval.
