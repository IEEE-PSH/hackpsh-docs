# Running the Project

## Manual Startup
It is recommended to understand how to startup the project manually in the case you want to startup a specific process.
#### 1. Start Supabase
Run the following command to start up Supabase:
```
npx supabase start
```
You can check the status of Supabase by running the command:
```
npx supabase status
```

#### 2. Migrate Tables
You should only migrate tables if you have not yet done so or if you changed a table.

Run the following command to migrate scripts for tables used for the database:
```
pnpm run migrate
```

#### 3. Run the Development Server
Run the following command to start up the development server:
```
pnpm dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the project live.

You can start editing a page such as `page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit and save the file.

(This project will require environment variables. If you get errors on environment variables, reach out to the Project Lead and paste them in a new file called `.env` in the root directory.)
