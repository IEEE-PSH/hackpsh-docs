# Setting Up Remotely

It is recommended to setup remotely through GitHub Codespaces since all requirements for the project are handled automatically. However, we recommend setting up locally if you experience performance issues.

# Starting Up Remotely

## Quickstart

You can easily startup all necessary processes by running this command:

```
pnpm run setup
```

This command will start up Supabase, migrate tables, and run the development server. It can be used everytime you startup the project. However, it is not recommended you run this command if one specific process is stopped.

## Manual Startup

It is recommended to understand how to startup the project manually in the case you want to startup a specific process.

### 1. Start Supabase

Run the following command to start up Supabase:

```
supabase start
```

You can check the status of Supabase by running the command:

```
supabase status
```

### 2. Migrate Tables

You should only migrate tables if you have not yet done so or if you changed a table. Run the following command to migrate scripts for tables used for the database:

```
pnpm run migrate
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

Run the following command to start up the development server:

```
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the project live.

You can start editing a page such as `page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit and save the file.

(This project will require environment variables. If you get errors on environment variables, reach out to the Project Lead and paste them in a new file called `.env` in the root directory.)
