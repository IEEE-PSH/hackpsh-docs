# Setting Up Remotely
It is recommended to setup remotely through GitHub Codespaces since all requirements for the project are handled automatically.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
**1. Install NodeJS**

* Visit [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) and install the recommended version for your machine.
* Ensure it is correctly installed by running this command in the terminal:
```
node
```
You should get an output similar to _Welcome to Node.js v18.14.0._ but for your version.

**2. Install pnpm**
* Visit [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) for installation instructions or run this command in the terminal:
```sh
# for windows
iwr https://get.pnpm.io/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```
If you are contributing to this project, use pnpm. Yarn and npm will **NOT** be used for consistency reasons.

**3. Install Docker Desktop**
* Visit [Docker Desktop Installation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) for installation instructions.
* Docker Desktop is used to run a local development container for _Supabase_, the service we will use for authentication and the database.

### Cloning the Repository
1. In VS Code, navigate to `View > Command Palette` or `Ctrl + Shift + P` and enter `Clone`.
2. Enter in the url: `https://github.com/IEEE-PSH/hackathon-web.git`.
3. Select a folder on your machine to save the repository.
4. Open the project.

## Running the Project
### Installing Dependencies
Run the following command to install all dependencies from `pnpm-lock.yaml`:
```
pnpm i
```
When you visit a branch for the first time, run this command to ensure all dependencies for that branch are installed.
### Running the Development Server
Run the following command to start up the development server:
```
pnpm dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the project live.

You can start editing a page such as `page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit and save the file.

(This project will require environment variables. If you get errors on environment variables, reach out to the Project Lead and paste them in a new file called `.env` in the root directory.)
