# Setting Up Locally
It is recommended to setup locally if you are experiencing performance issues with GitHub Codespaces. However, in contrast to setting up remotely, you will be required to install a few programs.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
**1. Install NodeJS**

* Visit [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) and install the recommended version for your machine.
* Ensure it is correctly installed by running this command in the terminal:
```
node
```
You should get an output similar to _Welcome to Node.js v18.14.0._ but for your version.

**2. Install pnpm**
* Visit [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) for installation instructions or run this command in the terminal:
```sh
# for windows
iwr https://get.pnpm.io/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```
If you are contributing to this project, use pnpm. Yarn and npm will **NOT** be used for consistency reasons.

**3. Install Docker Desktop**
* Visit [Docker Desktop Installation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) for installation instructions.
* Docker Desktop is used to run a local development container for _Supabase_, the service we will use for authentication and the database.

### Cloning the Repository
1. In VS Code, navigate to `View > Command Palette` or `Ctrl + Shift + P` and enter `Clone`.
2. Enter in the url: `https://github.com/IEEE-PSH/hackathon-web.git`.
3. Select a folder on your machine to save the repository.
4. Open the project.
